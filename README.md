I recently completed a charity project for Dnipro Development Agency that was written in Ruby on Rails and PSQL. The project's main objective was to find investors and attract support for the agency's charitable work. The project had two main parts: one for users and one for admin.

The user-facing part of the project was designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. It allowed potential investors to browse the agency's work and learn more about their initiatives. Users could view detailed information about each project, including its goals, budget, and expected outcomes. 

On the other hand, the admin section of the project was designed to give the Dnipro Development Agency team full control over the platform. They could manage the projects, articles, attachments, and user data in real-time. 

Overall, the project was a success and achieved its main goal of attracting new investors and raising awareness about the agency's work. I am proud of my contribution to this project, and I believe it will make a positive impact on the Dnipro community.
